Welcome to my Java github repository, here is a summary of my programs:

RSA encryption/decryption ----- This program gets input from a user and generates a public and private key based on the unicode of the input. It then displays the encrypted message to the console, decrypts it, and prints it again.
  
Barcode Scanner ----- This program scans in a barcode, determines if it is upside down, converts it to a decimal, and checks it against the checksum value.

WebCrawler ----- Starting at a URL inputted by the user, this program will work through all hyperlinks and document which links are broken on which page. It will then display the broken link report to the user at the end. I need to update this so it stops after a certain number of links travelled because it will run a long time. I have tested it in a smaller environment to test.

Raytracer ----- Raytracing is a method of rendering 3D objects and emulating photons to show light and shadows in a scene. This program creates a sphere and does calculations for lighting and shadow effects like a simple ray tracing program should.
